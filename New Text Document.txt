klein makes this headphone called TITAN headphone

but this headphone do not have any bluetooth

so klein wanted to make it bluetooth headphone

so he bought a small bluetooth adapter like this



he connects this bluetooth adapter to the Titan headphone and make it wireless


now the PTT on headphone can be pressed and worked with bluetooth

klein wants to make a copy of this bluetooth adapter
this wire cord is called K-cord


klein manufactures K-cord and Titan headphone. He will send me sample next week of both

we need to design a PCB for the bluetooth adapter that connects with this K-cord that connects to headphone
